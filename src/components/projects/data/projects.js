I decided to create a calculator for a medicine called Isotretinoin, which is used to treat Acne. When going through this treatment, you're supposed to reach a cumulative dose of 120-150 mg/kg. Due to side effects, the treatment time depends on how well you tolerate the medicine, and the dose can be adjusted during the treatment. This app helps you keep track of how far you've come to your goal dose.",
