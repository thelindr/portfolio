            I made as a student at the Technigo Bootcamp
            - a 12 week program to become a junior Frontend Developer.
            During the program we had one individual assignment each day,
            making a total of approximately 50 coding solutions.
            The 12 weeks were divided into 6 sprints, in which a bigger project
            was made in a team of four people.
